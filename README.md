## Introduction
The Moving Average Crossover Strategy is a popular trading strategy that uses two moving averages to identify trends and generate trading signals. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long term moving average, it generates a buy signal. When the short term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it generates a sell signal.
